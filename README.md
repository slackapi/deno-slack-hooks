# deno-slack-hooks

This library is intended to be used in applications running on Slack's next-generation application platform, focused on remixable
units of functionality encapsulated as ephemeral functions. It implements the communication contract between the
[Slack CLI][cli] and any Slack app development SDKs.

## Script Overrides

If you find yourself needing to override a hook script specified by this library, you can do so in your Slack app's `/slack.json` file! Just specify a new script for the hook in question. The hooks currently provided by this repo that can be overridden are `build`, `start`, and `get-manifest`.

Below is an example `/slack.json` file that overrides the `build` script to point to your local repo for development purposes.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "get-hooks": "deno run -q --unstable --allow-read --allow-net https://deno.land/x/deno_slack_hooks@0.0.5/mod.ts",
    "build": "deno run -q --unstable --config=deno.jsonc --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net /<path-to-your-local-repo>/mod.ts"
  }
}
```

The [Slack CLI][cli] will automatically know to pick up your local hook definition and use that instead of what's defined by this library.

This can also be used to change the flags sent to the `deno run` command if you decide to change the location of your config file, or switch to an import map instead.
